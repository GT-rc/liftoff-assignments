## Submission Instructions

### Overview

This project is intended to be a medication manager, and will be completed in multiple phases. The initial phase is already complete, please see the [repository](https://github.com/GT-rc/MedManager) for additional details.
The goal of this project is to allow users to have a list containing all of their medication details to make it easier to keep track of what they are taking and to share that information easily with their health care providers.

### Features

- This project allows a user to register and log in - it does support multiple users with unique data.
- All CRUD functionalities are covered.
- You can view a printable list of all medications and details to give to your doctor.
- Additional features to be added in coming phases include the ability to make sets, or categorize the medications as morning/noon/evening/night, and refill reminders.
- In a third phase may add an API to link in information about the medications themselves from drugs.com or the Physicians Desk Reference.

### Technologies

This project was built in C# using Visual Studio 2017. Styled with Bootstrap. Using an MSSQL local database.

### What I'll Have to Learn

I've done a great deal of research on Identity and Authentication for this project. In the initial build I created my own authentication framework, but found it to be incompatible with Identity. For the upcoming features, I will continue my research on setting up a repeating task for the refill functionality. I would also need to learn to integrate an API for the third iteration (and also find an API containing the information I'll need).
